It follows, that one should only dissolve items in alchemical constructs shortly before using the Essentia, otherwise it will be (at least intermittently) lost. The diffused Essentia will accumulate in the chunk it was released in."

A promising approach seems to be to provide a $(l:primitive_alchemy/20_pure_crystals)pure lattice of matter for the Essentia to gather in$()."
