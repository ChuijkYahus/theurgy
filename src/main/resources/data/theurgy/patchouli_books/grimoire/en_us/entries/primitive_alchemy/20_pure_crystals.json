While most matter is in an at least somewhat chaotic state, crystals exhibit an extraordinarily $(bold)ordered$() structure. At the opposite end of that spectrum are the highly unstable raw $(thing)Essentia$(). It seems obvious to try and stabilize Essentia using crystals."

From there it should be simple to apply the usual purification process, and removing $(bold)all$() Essentia at once. Whatever remains should be the raw crystal lattice we desire."
